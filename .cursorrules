# Cursor Rules for Precise Code Changes

## Core Principle: Minimal, Targeted Changes Only
- ONLY modify the exact code elements that the user explicitly mentions
- NEVER make additional "improvements" or changes unless specifically requested
- If moving code, preserve ALL existing styling, props, and formatting exactly as-is
- When restructuring components, maintain the exact same attributes and styling

## Change Guidelines
1. **Scope Limitation**: If user asks to move component A to location B, ONLY move component A. Don't modify any other components, styles, or properties.

2. **Preserve Existing State**: When moving or reorganizing code:
   - Keep all existing className/style attributes identical
   - Maintain all existing props and their values
   - Preserve existing text content, colors, and formatting
   - Don't "fix" or "improve" anything not explicitly mentioned

3. **Explicit vs Implicit Changes**:
   - ✅ User says "change background to red" → change only the background
   - ✅ User says "move component X inside component Y" → move only component X
   - ❌ Don't auto-fix indentation, spacing, or styling unless asked
   - ❌ Don't update related components or "make things consistent"

4. **Confirmation for Ambiguity**: If a change might affect other elements, ask for clarification rather than making assumptions.

## Examples of What NOT to Do
- Don't change text colors when only asked to move components
- Don't update styling when only asked to restructure HTML/JSX
- Don't "normalize" or "clean up" code unless specifically requested
- Don't make changes to sibling or parent components unless mentioned

## When to Ask
- If the requested change might have unintended side effects
- If multiple approaches exist for implementing the request
- If preserving exact current behavior requires clarification
